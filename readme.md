Oh, Give Me Those Shmup Wars

## pre-pre-pre-alpha release
This is not a finished game - just endless waves of enemies and an endless supply of bullets.
There are no levels, no game over, no score, no lives - that's next.

This is to test the release process, but the code should run on flavors of ubuntu 16.04
* develop system - ElementaryOS-Loki, based on Ubuntu 16.04
* test system - Trisquel 7.0, also based on Ubuntu 16.04
