Is Vala Dead?
I may not agree with recent concersations on Gnome about Vala, but ...
Even if they don't outright drop it, it reveals that there is no support for Vala at Gnome.
So for now, I'm shopping around.


Main branch - Reboot #2 - wip

replacing bosco with libsdx

libsdx is inspired by libgdx. Similar shape to the api hierarchy,
but much simpler - uses SDL and Vala/Genie rather than  OpenGL and Java
